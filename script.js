hi guys can we discuss scheduling rq

yeah for me im probs gonna be a bit busier over like the next two weeks due to internship stuff. 

what would help is if we can shift the time backwards a little (like 9:00pm-12:00pm). I'd probably leave at 11ish to sleep tho.

Haha yeah originally when we created the schedule it was just my schedule I used for ao. It was kinda random.

We shaved some time off, and reorganized it a bit, but uh yeah now that we have new members and stuff we might wanna reorganize
